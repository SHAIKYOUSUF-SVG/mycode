oops is nothing but binding the data and functions as a single unit so that no function
or code can can be access the code


conceopts:
class
attributes
encapsulation
polymorphism
inheritance
data abstraction/data hiding


class:class is local entity thst has some specific attributes and methods

attribute:
attributes are the variables that belong to a class or object
attributes can functions taht defined inside  class level or object level
class attributes can access thorugh out the clas
attributes are used to store the data
types of qattoibutes:public,private,protected
public can access form outside the class also
privated attibutes can access only with in class we cant access outside
protected: can access out side  hte class and f=in drived class also

methods:
functions that are definied inside a class
functions are written to access or update the attibutes

object:
instance of class and object has state and behaviour tied with it

__init__:[constructor/initializer]
__init__ uis used inside class to f=define attirbutes here  weuse a default jey word self
self is not fixed word based on pep8 guif=de lines we wrote that wprd
we we create object to a class construicter will get automatically initailized

Encspsulation:
encapsulation means making attribute private and atomaccess attributes we wrote methods
here we just h=show code functionality

polymorphism:
means accessing methods based in objects
define method with same names in parent and child class based on object
output will come

inheritance:
single inheritance:
accessing properties of parent class from a simgle child class


multiple inheritance:
a single class inherited  by multiple patent class
or
when i single class be derived more than oe parent class


multilevel inheritance:
deriving a child class from another class which is derived from another class

hirarchial inherutance:
more than one clss was inherited from one parent class


hybrid inheritance:
inheritance cosisting of multiple types of inheritance is called hybrid inheritance
