pep8 guidelines
python enhancement proposal
this will give us few guidlines on how to write the code in specific format

*dont wirte functionname in upeercase
*if object is standerd/fixed then we have to assaign with capital name
*when we creating a package dont give in filename "_" but we use _ for
module filenames and module name in small letters
*dont use x,y,z as object names
*always write module names according to function code [like what we are doing]
*while writting multiple classes always gives 2lines space for deviding
ex:
class new_list:
    pass


class new_dict:
    pass


class squares:
    pass

*b/w every method use 1line space
*indentation use 4 spaces
*no.of charecters in a line should be 76
def function(arg_one, arg_two, arg_three, arg_four)
def function(arg_one, arg_two,
             arg_three, arg_four)
from mypkg import example1, exampl2, exmaple3

from mypkg import example1, \
exampl2, exmaple3'

total=(first_variable
       + second_variable
       - third_variable)

#give \ if same line code extend to another line

*in python3 we cant use mix spaces and tab
*it will show indentation error
*in python2 we can have mix of spaces and tabs,programe will excute
#in python2 how to check if we have mix of spaces and tabs
#python -t file1.py  #-t will give warning if we wrote mix of tabs and spaces
#python -tt file.py gives error if we wrote in mix of tabs and spaces
*comment should be 72 chars
*dont use comment in shortcut
* in a function if you want to comment even that is a line use ''' '''
*it will actlike docstring
*linter-used to enalis the code

q:what are linters?
use to analysis the code
pycodestyle and black
black filename.py  it will auto recorrect that file
q:how to run /convert code of python2 to python3
first we need to check
where python
and go to tool
inside tool go to scripts  there 2to3.py file will there
copy that file path
paste that path in cmd and -w filename.py
it will convert python2 code to python3
syntax:
C:\Users\91998\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Tools\scripts\2to3.py -w py2to3.py


q:pyupgarde?
to convert python older code to newer python format
pip install pyupgrade
it will little impoment of syntax overwrite
rewrite the code
