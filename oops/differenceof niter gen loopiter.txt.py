'''normal iterator:
take huge run time ,data
huge space is required to store the data
need to prepare the data before using it
always loops starts from first

generator:
take less run time
less place required when compared to normal iterator
data will prepare on the fly
loop will start from where it was stops

oops-iterator:
less run time than generator
take less data
code will prepare on the fly
loop will start from it was stops
