#we go class for create own data type
#we can create my ownlist which can store only integers
#class means data type and inside class there will be methods [we dont call them functions]
#any function written inside a class is a method
#methods are always tide/attached with class
class bank:  #here bank is own datatype
    def test1(self):
        print("a")
    def test2(self):
        print("b")

b1=bank()  #bank() is class compring it as b1 like x=list()
b1.test1()

'''
data=[]
data=list()   #list methods-append,isert remove,pop,copy,cler,count
data.append()  #how we call methods

d={}  #keys,values,items,pop,remove,cop,clear,pop item
d.keys()
